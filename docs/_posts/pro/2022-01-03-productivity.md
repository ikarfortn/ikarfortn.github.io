## not obliged not by OCD
1. You are not obliged to send replies
2. You are not obliged to text
3. You donot need to talk if you donot want to
4. You donot need to keep everything in active memory 
5. You are not obliged to help at your own cost

## **MELTDOWN REGULATORS you are trying at the moment**
  1. upset, irritated? -> eat
  2. if 1. doesnot work -> try eating amla
  3. if 2. doesnot work -> try cold head shower and order tapioca pearl tea
  4. if 3. doesnot work -> take clonazepam [lAST rESORT]

## **PRODUCTIVITY HACKS**
- very distracted -> schedule focusmate / myfocusspace for the coming hour
- use pomodoro timer [Time's Up]
- Use smart reminders 
- Read Flynn and orbit everyday
