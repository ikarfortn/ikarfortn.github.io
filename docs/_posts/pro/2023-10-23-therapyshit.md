# Controlling emotions and stoicism 
## Refocus on the present
Acceptance starts with acknowledging the reality of something, without judgment. Like... if I'm outside doing something and it starts to rain, no matter how much I shake my fist at the sky the rain ain't gonna stop, so I might as well accept the reality of the situation and then refocus on what I can do for myself.

## Expectations
Basically you have a bunch of little stories and truths you tell yourself about how things 'should' or 'must' be. In REBT this is referred to as the "Tyranny of the Shoulds" and "Musterbation." These lead to what are called "irrational beliefs" or in Stoicism they are called False Impressions.

## Biology
logic -> frontal lobe
emotions -> amygdala
- practice *not the body not even the mind*
- take turmeric, pepper consistently
- take b long and make sure you get Vit E (moringa)

## what are your most common emotional problems?
not being able to control reaching out to someone who does not reach out to me. 

Why?  
I am scared that the person leaving will reinforce and confirm the idea that nobody ever liked me really. 

Momento mori   
What if nobody likes you? Why should it matter?

Past issues and unresolved trauma
I was very attached to my brother. But then I never felt like he accepted me as a friend. I felt like he slowly disappeared out of my life. As I grew closer to puberty I felt the distance between us grew and I felt confused about my identity as a person. I also felt very close to a friend in school who I didn't talk much to, but was a tutor to. I also felt he was sort of a younger brother to me even although he is older. I spent time watching videogame clips of mortal combat and solving sums and correcting his essays mostly. But I never thought he would disappear from my life without telling me. But he was gone one day and it felt just like Vivek disappearing. However, I did reach out in this case but never got a respone.

I never reached out or tried to patch up things with Vivek, we are still cousins but I would say that I do not see myself being "friends" with him like I was as a kid. I miss the old bond that we had but I do not thing there is a contemprory equivalent of it. It was natural for it to die. I still have that sort of fandom sort of awe whenever he is physically present near me. I am a cold person who used to have a lot of ego and it was only to him I felt like a kid. I believe I seek that experience. 

I hold a lot of shame about feeling needy, emotional. I get very offended if someone tells me I talked too much or that I am needy. My ego had fucked off for a bit but it was not good to have no ego. Nowadays my ego is back again. But with pradeep I do not feel that ego.   
I feel safe acting needy and desperate towards him.  
And it doesn't feel bad to me even when metaphorically in a sense spits on my face.   
I do not often perceive people as older to me but I do perceive him as older than me.  
And I feel comfortable being needy, weak, desperate and clingy around him.   
However, I do not want to just be that person. It is okay to occassionally be like that but I do not think it is reasonable as an adult to act like that often.  

I feel like if he actually leaves it would serve as confirmation that nobody ever liked me. Therefore, I somehow try to keep the illusion running that he does infact like me. 

But a month ago he told me **he wished that I fucked off**. I didn't really get what he meant but that makes sense thinking of the 50/50 comment, me starting this again as a result of begging him to mentor me, him saying that he'd rather block now and avoid textwalls, him telling me to not invest, him often telling me to see other people, saying F when I told him that I missed him. It makes sense that I create a prison that he cannot really leave and then look for small clues like him saying that I am cute and him wanting to see my face as reinforcement that he does infact likes me. But if he liked me he would have called me to talk to me. I know that. I spam him if he leaves me on read, I chose to text him from another number when he blocked me on now and I overall act crazy and anxious whenever he leaves. 

But now that we are not really fighting or anything, **I think I can just leave slowly**. 
Control my emotions to not reach out and try stablizing my life for the better.  
I know that the thoughts that say: nobody wants to see your face, that nobody cares about anything but your body, that people don't want to spend time with you really, people just hate you and you are needy and weird and nerdy are just negative thoughts projected on me.

Akshaya, abnik like hanging out with me. Preetha does want to spend time with me, I think. Sg has wanted to see me for some time now. My parents love me and love hearing from me.  

## Resolution strategies

- Delaying Judgement 
  - You wait a second before being emotional, realize you are about to be emotional, but instead choose to not be. It will feel very wrong the first couple of times, but eventually you gain the superpower of not following your emotions.
  - A lot of people I meet **just react to things** , they don't have the extra step where they **actually take in information and process it** . It takes time and comes more naturally to some than others but stop reacting to things and start observing. **Not everything requires a reaction** , and a lot of the way we behave and act would change if we actually took the time to **reframe a situation or see that really it's out of our control** .
  - It is not in your control if someone replies or not
  - It is not in your control if someone likes you back
  - It is not in your control to initiate
  - It is in your control to determine to react
  - It is in your control to decide to shout or plead

- Riding the emotion
  - Think of emotions as messages in your inbox
  - Ding! A new emotion has arrived
  - An emotion or feeling or impression
  -  it's just a messenger. You've placed a value judgment on something, some outcome or person or thing or whatever. Something is "good" or "bad" or you've made some personal story out of it.
  - What you can do is dig down and reason through those things, see if you can shift your opinion, find another perspective, re-write an old narrative
  - The first judgment we tend to jump to is that we've "lost" a "good" thing. That we'll never see them again. We can reshape that perspective in that all things are on borrowed time and we've merely returned something for the time being. For right now we've made space for things more aligned to us, and freed up time and energy to work on ourselves, learn a lesson, etc. Maybe we'll find a new connection with that person down the road, maybe not, but there's no sense in predicting or concluding about the future.

- Do the best of things in your control
  - Ik that with an exam we already approach it this way. I focus on learning everything that can be asked instead of focusing on getting > x marks
  - Similarly with life, are you the best version of yourself to this person? If you are the best version of yourself and they react badly, then leave. If you are the best version of yourself, fix that instead of hoping for good reactions.

## Before reacting
1. Think will it not be nice to break this cycle for myself
2. Write out your thoughts out in the third person, followed by giving advice.
3. Write about what I'm feeling, followed by ferreting out the root belief I have always assumed to be a true representation of reality. Then I see if that belief is universal, can be exchanged with different players as **heroes/victims**. Finally, I give myself a more reasonable belief to apply to the situation.
4. Grounding routine when feeling overwhelmed.
